@par Application Description

 This application describes how to configure LCD touch screen and attribute 
 an action related to configured touch zone and how to save BMP picture in SDCard.
 
 At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
 all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
 Then the SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system
 clock (SYSCLK) to run at 180 MHz. 

 After LCD and touch screen initialization, touchscreen calibration is requested
 for better accuracy, then, menu is displayed on the screen. 
 
 The menu contains palette of colors, clear icon, save icon, different kind 
 of draw size, the current selected size, selected color and working rectangle. 

 Select one of proposed colors and select the size of brush to draw 
 inside the working rectangle.
 
 Clear the working window by pressing the clear icon or/and save the picture 
 in SDCard by pressing the save icon.

  - LED1 is on to indicate the end of saving operation.
  - LED3 is ON when any error occurs.

Note: After save operation, the touch positions are not cleared from STMPE811 FIFO 
      and the next touch in any positions of the LCD screen leads second save 
      operation.


@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.
